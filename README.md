## Introduction

Quantum cryptography leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to create secure communication protocols that are theoretically immune to certain types of attacks. This project provides implementations of three key protocols in quantum cryptography:
- **Quantum One-Time Pad (QOTP)**
- **Quantum Digital Signatures (QDS)**
- **Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS)**

Each protocol is implemented with a focus on clarity and usability, accompanied by graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for easy interaction and visualization.

## Features

- **Quantum One-Time Pad (QOTP)**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using a randomly generated key.
- **Quantum Digital Signatures (QDS)**: Create and validate digital signatures for message integrity and authenticity.
- **Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS)**: Implement a three-party protocol for secure sharing of a secret using GHZ states.

## Installation

To use this toolkit, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

### Quantum One-Time Pad (QOTP)

1. **Encrypting a Message**:
   - Enter a binary message and a binary key of the same length.
   - Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the encrypted message.

2. **Decrypting a Message**:
   - Enter the encrypted message and the same binary key.
   - Click the "Decrypt" button to retrieve the original message.

3. **Generating a Random Key**:
   - Enter a binary message.
   - Click the "Generate Random Key" button to create a key of the same length.

### Quantum Digital Signatures (QDS)

1. **Generating Keys**:
   - Enter a binary message.
   - Click the "Generate Keys" button to create private and public keys for each bit.

2. **Signing a Message**:
   - Click the "Sign Message" button to sign the message using the private keys.

3. **Validating a Signature**:
   - Click the "Validate Signature" button to verify the message using the public keys.

### Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS)

1. **Running the Protocol**:
   - Click the "Run QSS Protocol" button to execute the secret sharing protocol.
   - The measurement results and chosen bases for Alice, Bob, and Charlie will be displayed.
